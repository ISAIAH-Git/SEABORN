# SEABORN INTRODUCTION :
 Seaborn is a library for making statistical infographics in Python. It is built on top of matplotlib and also supports numpy and pandas data structures. It also supports statistical units from SciPy. Visualization plays an important role when we try to explore and understand data, Seaborn is aimed to make it easier and the centre of the process.The Seaborn library is built on top of Matplotlib and offers many advanced data visualization capabilities. Though, the Seaborn library can be used to draw a variety of charts such as matrix plots, grid plots, regression plots etc., in this article we will see how the Seaborn library can be used to draw distributional...
